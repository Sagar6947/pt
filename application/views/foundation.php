								<h3>Talking Books</h3>
								<p>Talking Pen enabled books contain everything from early learning lessons, key topics, rhymes and stories like regular books. Only difference is that users can read out the text by touching the Talking Pen on the printed words of the books. 

This will help even the most unwilling, vulnerable child to grow interest in books and even  visually impaired learners, dyslexic children or kids with learning disabilities to enjoy the written content of books even when they do not have access to a proper classroom or a teacher.
